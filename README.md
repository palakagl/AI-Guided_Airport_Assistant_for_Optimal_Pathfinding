# AI-Guided_Airport_Assistant_for_Optimal_Pathfinding

### Purpose statement:

After Covid when travel resumed last year, Pearson was declared 2nd worst airport in the world and this year its declared as the worst. In this type of economic recession, airport authority can't just go on hiring spree, they need a change and they need to automate and digitalize things around us. This is gonna come with its challenges but it would be the right step in future. 

### Proposed Solution: 

Introducing Carie Bot that was designed as AI guided Airport Assistant for Optimal Pathfinding. It will help customers move around in the airport quickly and efficiently.

### Model: DQN

Deep Q Learning is a popular approach for solving complex problems in larger state spaces, where traditional Q-Learning algorithms may not perform optimally due to the extensive computation required to traverse all states and update Q values iteratively. As such, the use of function approximation techniques can help overcome this limitation by estimating the optimal Q function. In particular, Deep Q Networks (DQNs) leverage the power of deep neural networks to approximate Q values for each state-action pair in a given environment, with the goal of approximating the optimal Q function.

The DQN approach involves training a deep neural network to estimate Q values for each action in a given state. This network is optimized by minimizing the difference between the outputted Q values and the target Q values derived from the Bellman equation, which characterizes the optimal Q function. This optimization process is performed using stochastic gradient descent and backpropagation to update the weights in the neural network iteratively until the loss is sufficiently minimized.

The Bellman equation remains the foundation of Deep Q Learning, but with the use of neural networks, it becomes possible to estimate Q values and find the optimal Q function efficiently, even in large state spaces. In summary, Deep Q Learning offers a powerful and efficient approach to solving complex problems, which can be achieved by combining the Bellman equation with deep neural networks to estimate Q values and approximate the optimal Q function.
